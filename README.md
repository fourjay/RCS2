This is a set of autocommands, commands, and a menu to help you handle RCS controlled files.

If you try to modify a readonly file that has a RCS/<file>,v counterpart you will be asked if you want to check the file out for modification, and when you unload the buffer you'll be prompted if you want to check the file back in, and allowed to enter a log message.

Most of the commands have corresponding menu items, which should be fairly self-explanatory.

Details are in the auto-generated help file, see ":help rcs.txt".
